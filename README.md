## üìò Overview

This project provides a consultancy report for the merger of two companies, recommending a **Hybrid Infrastructure** to meet their unique operational, security and compliance needs. The proposed solution balances **On-Premises** and **Cloud (Azure)** infrastructure to optimize cost, scalability, security, and efficiency.

---

## üìù Key Highlights

### **Objective**:
- Evaluate the current infrastructure of two merging companies.
- Provide recommendations for integrating On-Prem and Cloud solutions.
- Address cost-effectiveness, scalability, and security concerns.

### **Proposed Solution**:
- Adopt a **Hybrid Infrastructure**:
  - Retain sensitive data on-premises for compliance and ownership.
  - Migrate less critical workloads to Azure for scalability and cost efficiency.
- Tools and technologies included:
  - **On-Prem**: VLAN, ACL, DHCP, NAT, Storage Replica, Active Directory.
  - **Cloud**: Azure DevTest Labs, Azure TCO Calculator, Azure Files, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

### **Outcomes**:
- Improved **data security** and **compliance** for sensitive workloads.
- Reduced operational costs with **Azure's pay-as-you-go model**.
- Enhanced scalability for developer environments and public-facing resources.

## üìä Results

### üí∞ Cost Benefits of Moving to Azure
1. Annual savings of **NOK 27,209,049** by moving storage to Azure Files.
   ! [TCO Calculator Results for DFS System](assets/Results DFS system in TCO.png)   
3.  Developer environment migration savings of **NOK 199,187,778** by utilizing Azure DevTest Labs for dynamic scaling.
   ! [TCO Calculator Results for Developer Environment](assets/Results of Developer env in TCO.png) 

### üîë How These Savings Are Achieved:
- **Pay-as-You-Go Model**: Eliminates upfront capital expenses for hardware, replacing them with flexible operational costs that scale with usage.
- **Operational Cost Reduction**: Reduces expenses related to IT maintenance, cooling, electricity, and software licensing.
- **Dynamic Scalability**: Azure DevTest Labs allows seamless scaling of resources during high demand and automatic cost reductions during downtime.

### üåü Why It Matters:
- Startups companies benefit from improved budget flexibility and reduced financial risks.
- Azure‚Äôs advanced cost management tools, such as tagging for cost allocation, budget tracking, and real-time alerts, ensure resource efficiency and prevent overspending.

By leveraging Azure‚Äôs hybrid infrastructure capabilities, critical workloads remain securely on-premises while non-sensitive workloads take full advantage of Azure‚Äôs scalability, cost efficiency, and availability. This approach aligns IT infrastructure with business growth objectives, enabling innovation and sustained success.

## üìò Overview

This project provides a consultancy report for the merger of two companies, recommending a **Hybrid Infrastructure** to meet their unique operational, security and compliance needs. The proposed solution balances **On-Premises** and **Cloud (Azure)** infrastructure to optimize cost, scalability, security, and efficiency.

---

## üìù Key Highlights

### **Objective**:
- Evaluate the current infrastructure of two merging companies.
- Provide recommendations for integrating On-Prem and Cloud solutions.
- Address cost-effectiveness, scalability, and security concerns.

### **Proposed Solution**:
- Adopt a **Hybrid Infrastructure**:
  - Retain sensitive data on-premises for compliance and ownership.
  - Migrate less critical workloads to Azure for scalability and cost efficiency.
- Tools and technologies included:
  - **On-Prem**: VLAN, ACL, DHCP, NAT, Storage Replica, Active Directory.
  - **Cloud**: Azure DevTest Labs, Azure TCO Calculator, Azure Files, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

### **Outcomes**:
- Improved **data security** and **compliance** for sensitive workloads.
- Reduced operational costs with **Azure's pay-as-you-go model**.
- Enhanced scalability for developer environments and public-facing resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### **Technologies Used**:
- **On-Prem Tools**: Packet Tracer, Windows Server, VLANs, NAT, DNS, ACLs.
- **Cloud Tools**: Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Files, RBAC, Azure TCO Calculator.

### **Architecture Overview**:
- **On-Premises**:
  - Dual-location setup with segregated VLANs and replication mechanisms for disaster recovery.
  - Security enhanced via least privilege access and zero-trust principles.
- **Cloud Integration**:
  - Utilized Azure ExpressRoute for private connections between on-premises and cloud environments.
  - Recommended moving developer workloads and DFS system to Azure for scalability.

## üìä Results

### **Cost Savings**:
- Annual savings of **27M NOK** for DFS workloads.
- Developer environment migration savings of **199M NOK** (based on Azure TCO Calculator).

### **Scalability**:
- Dynamic scaling for development and testing workloads using Azure DevTest Labs.

### **Security**:
- Zero-trust model enforced with VLANs, ACLs, and Azure RBAC.
